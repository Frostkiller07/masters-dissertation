# Master’s Dissertation – Air Quality Data Analysis

This repository contains the complete Python (Jupyter Notebook) implementation for my Master’s dissertation project.  
The notebook includes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modelling, and results**, along with all generated outputs.
